        Wow, I finally got it to work. </h1>

    <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">You won't believe just how long this took. I've been working on this site 
        for the last three hours and only now figured out how to work git. 
        Luckily, just getting to this poitn basically means I'm like halfway done.
        I just hope that doesn't mean I have to work for another three hours.</p>

    <h2>On to the actual work</h2>
    <p>I'm not going to lie to you, there isnt anything here. Instead, 
        I'm just going to add in some lorem ipsom. Enjoy.</p>
