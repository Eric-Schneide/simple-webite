        Wow, I finally got it to work. </h1>

    <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        You won't believe just how long this took. I've been working on this site 
        for the last three hours and only now figured out how to work git. 
        Luckily, just getting to this poitn basically means I'm like halfway done.
        I just hope that doesn't mean I have to work for another three hours.</p>

    <h2>On to the actual work</h2>
    <p>I'm not going to lie to you, there isnt anything here. Instead, 
        I'm just going to add in some lorem ipsom. Enjoy.</p>

                <p>I do realize that this is minimum of work, but it is still a test.</p>
                <p>If there is another assignment I'll do more and if a new project comes 
                   I'm just planning to start anew with a new website.</p>

            <h2>All in all. I've got to say this is interesting</h2>
            <p>
                I still wouldn't say that I'm a big fan of web design, but 
                I do hate it much less now. After all It's ony been like three 
                years since I've actually tried to do something like this, 
                and I have to say it does seem easier to comprehend overall.
                In fact, I'm kind of excited for the actual portfolio project 
                just so that I can make my own acual website from scratch 
                (And not an experiment type like this. something I'd actually publish to the Web).
                Honestly, I'm not the most interested in things like this, but I have to say it 
                does peek my interest when I save the file and actually look at the website and think
                "I made that." I honestly love the feeling I get when I look at a finished project 
                because it validates the journey in getting to that point. I'm all for beliveing that 
                the journey is important, but it's useless if you never reach the destination.
                Can't wait for the next project.
